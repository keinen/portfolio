        <h2>Selling Design</h2>

        <h4>Selling design starts with good business</h4>
    </div>

    <h6>Over the years I have worked in web, I have discovered one of the most important things about selling design is that we sell solutions to real business problems that have a real impact.</h6>

    <p>Recently I was in a meeting with a software partner company when one of my colleagues says “You just do pretty stuff, we do the real heavy lifting”</p>


    <p>It gets my gears stuck when people refer to the things we do as the ‘pretty stuff’ and when they do, I know I have done a bad job of communicating what it is we actually do.</p>
    <p>We solve complex business problems for organisations of all sizes. It’s not just pretty pictures and buttons.</p>

    <p>Its varying stakeholder needs, ambiguity and constraint, context, peoples livelihood and businesses we take into our hands.</p>

    <p> All organisations have problems that impact on their bottom line or organisational objectives. Weather they have a direct financial impact or an indirect financial impact.</p>

    <p>Direct financial impact: - We aren’t selling enough of product x
        Indirect financial impact: - There is not enough awareness that bullying affects everyone</p>

    <p> With the web being the place more and more people turn to to make the best decision they can, we have a responsibility to the people who hire us to look at their business from all angles.</p>

    <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0HlTPnnfzRsf4f2U" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/pgtips-l0HlTPnnfzRsf4f2U">via GIPHY</a></p>

    <p> Our job is to use the tools and technologies we have available to us to help organisations solve those problems. It’s like a test or exam. Read the question and understand it before solving it.</p>

    <p> First we listen. Listen to as many stakeholders that the problem touches possible. Where possible talk to the organisations customers and audience.</p>

    <p> Then we understand. We take what we have heard and think about it. Understand the whys’ and the hows. We may even have more questions so we listen again.</p>

    <p> Then we look for a solution. A measured solution that takes into account what we have heard and understood. A solution that solves a business problem using the design tools we have available to us.</p>

    <p> Selling design is about solving problems businesses have. In solving problems, measured against tangible impacts we move away from selling pretty pictures and lift the profile of what we do.</p>
